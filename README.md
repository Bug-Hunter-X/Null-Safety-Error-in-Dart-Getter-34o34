This repository demonstrates a common null safety error in Dart that can occur when using null-aware operators in getters.  The getter `myVar` in `MyClass` attempts to handle a potentially null `_myVar` using `?? 0`, but this results in an error because the getter is declared as `int` which is not nullable.  The solution shows how to correctly handle this scenario.
